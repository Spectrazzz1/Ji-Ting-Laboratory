# DB Website Template

Basic template/playground for the core of the game databases I have. This repository includes snippets of code that is, or is not, being actually used on them.

Final implementation is different for each one of the websites I have, so feel free to use this piece of code as an example for whatever your purpose is, or anything else.

## The goal

The goal of this is to serve as a template / collection of code snippets, that are heavily used within my own projects.

Main goal is to produce a fast, non resource intensive, extendable and configurable website. The root is `express + pug`, other alternatives like `Nuxt3, Vue, Koa + pug, EJS, etc.` were also taken into consideration and discarded later on, being it due to performance, complexity, or any other combination of issues.

## Contributing

Any kind of contribution is welcome, there are not set guidelines for it, so feel free to open any pull request at will. Chances are that as long as it doesn't break anything that has been made on this template, it will be merged.
